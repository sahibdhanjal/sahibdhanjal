I'm currently a Perception Engineer working with [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/) on **3D Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning** and **Mathematical Optimization** algorithms to make eXtended Reality a more comfortable everyday experience. Prior to that, I was working with [Magna - Lyft L5](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a19445506/lyft-and-magna-enter-long-term-deal-to-develop-self-driving-systems/) building multi-layered HD maps and deploying deep learning solutions for highly constrained environments.

### 🚀 Current Focus
- 📚 3D Computer Vision, SLAM and Deep Learning for AR/VR/Self-Driving Cars
- 🌐 Building a collection of productivity tools on [Gumroad](https://sheetsbyboozie.gumroad.com/)
- ✍🏻 Blogging about things I pick up along the way on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sahibdhanjal)
