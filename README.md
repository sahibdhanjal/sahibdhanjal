I'm currently a Software Engineer working with [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/) working on **3D Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning** and **Mathematical Optimization** algorithms to make Augmented Reality a more comfortable everyday experience. Prior to that, I was working on Localization and Mapping for Autonomous Vehicles at [Magna/Lyft](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a19445506/lyft-and-magna-enter-long-term-deal-to-develop-self-driving-systems/) as a part of their joint venture.

### 🚀 Current Focus
- 📚 3D Computer Vision, SLAM and Deep Learning for AR/VR/Self-Driving Cars
- 🌐 Building a collection of productivity tools on [Gumroad](https://sheetsbyboozie.gumroad.com/)
- ✍🏻 Blogging about things I pick up along the way on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sahibdhanjal)
